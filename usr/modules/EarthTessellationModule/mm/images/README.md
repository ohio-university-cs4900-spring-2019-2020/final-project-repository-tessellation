# Installation of Data Files
In order for this module to run correctly, some data files need to be downloaded and installed in this directory.

The terrain elevation dataset, ETOPO1_Ice_g_geotiff can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/data/ice_surface/grid_registered/georeferenced_tiff/). Extract the geotiff from the zip and install it directly in this directory (not in a subdirectory of this directory).

The earth imagery texture, 2_no_clouds_16k, can be downloaded from [here](http://shadedrelief.com/natural3/ne3_data/16200/textures/2_no_clouds_16k.jpg). Install it directly into this directory.

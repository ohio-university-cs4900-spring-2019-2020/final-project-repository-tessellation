# Downloading and Building
In order to build this project, the files in the engine subdirectory must be installed in the AftrBurnerEngine engine directory, and the engine must be built. The files in the usr subdirectory must be installed in the AftrBurnerEngine usr directory, and then the EarthTessellationModule located in usr/modules/EarthTessellationModule can be configured and built.

To run the resulting program, some files need to be downloaded and installed. See [here](usr/modules/EarthTessellationModule/mm/images/README.md) for more details.
